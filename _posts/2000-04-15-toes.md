Of the days that dwell within    
    the numbness of my toes    
    and the hours spent in    
    concentration quiet and intense -    
    
Blankness in some guise has    
     found me with clamped eyes    
     and pinched nostrils,    
     leaning back into the fall    
    and looking only at the    
    retreating face of imagination    
    and hope.    
    
I trust that resolves the issue.
