Where ever shall I go to find myself a drink    
    to match my thirst?    
I fancy myself a drinker, with a fair grasp of    
the chords and melodies - and a spirited dancer.    
    
One should grow new eyes each day -    
and save the old, to constantly remember the world    
as it was just five minutes prior.
