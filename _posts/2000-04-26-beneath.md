At times I wish only that my heart would open inside my mind,    
that I might cry with new sorrow and weep new tears of salt and mist.    
But I am hard and stubborn and have only a vague idea    
of what beauty may or may not be.    
    
Why write and for what humanity? To be a child...    
To be again loved as a child; to again yearn for the self indulgence indulged a child...    
    yet more than death waits    
        for those who wait    
            for love
