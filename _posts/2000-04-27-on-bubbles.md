How would one justify the extent of the madness -    
    what is the weight, in grams, of the lie for which we    
    built the house    
    
And once the house was built and mortar dry and    
    tapestries and paintings clothed the walls    
    to end the hollow echoing through empty rooms    
    
And when children emerged from tiny rooms to play    
    and run and roll down stairs and scrape the walls    
    and stain the rugs and to let goldfish die    
    
And when dinner parties lasted late into the evening    
    followed by coffee and cigars, and the furniture    
    had to be replaced for the sake of social status,    
    and the guest rooms torn down to make the library    
    of books never opened past their inscriptions on the third page    
    and the chipped china of wedding presents thrown out    
    rather than given to charity    
    
And when the children were no longer that but something else    
    and rather like a mirror which does not fade in the absence    
    of light, and when they themselves invariably vanished one    
        day    
    to be replaced by the hand of the postman full of bills    
    and blank postcards and the occasional ringing phone    
    
And when retirement leapt out in ambush armed with    
    reasons and sensibilities too many and too great to    
    vanquish    
    
And when the thousands of admirers who had once graced    
    the presence of the house and worn her into something    
    fashionable suddenly become as mist, and rooms so long    
    unused and filled with vague memories of once important things    
    become too much to look at    
    
When the house becomes too much to bear, old and alone,    
    and the thought of a quiet townhouse with no yards or maids    
    seems as beautiful or tangible as winter roses    
    
When the time comes to sell and move on:    
    
Does the lie still follow you? Or was it bundled with the mortgage?
