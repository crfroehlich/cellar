Of all the emptiness and disdain -    
    for which I have no explanation    
    but the mass consumption of human spirit -    
    the lengths to which man (myself, foremost of the cast)    
        will to which    
        and find his own destruction;    
    the manner in which we cast ourselves the    
    fool and the lonely lot of living in open    
        graves -    
    
I have found nothing to prove myself    
    holy, nor in that search anything to    
    make the days be anything but a    
        suffering laid upon the altar for a    
        God who sees me as I truly am.    
    
Pity nihilism does not offer me the fortitude    
of blasphemy.
