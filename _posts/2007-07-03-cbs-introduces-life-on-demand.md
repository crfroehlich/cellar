In the absence of truly innovative reality TV programming, CBS executives propose to cross the entertainment threshold by introducing your life, on demand. Watch moments of your past, present, or potential futures in real time--only when you desire to experience it. That first kiss in slow motion. Your first sky dive adventure three years from now in the Amazon. Your elite training in a Chinese counter-terrorism, joint, international task force to eradicate counter-government international task forces. All of it available on your television, at your leisure. CBS executives do provide one disclaimer: "CBS cannot be held responsible for broadcasts of future events that individual audience members fail to enact in their own lives due to time spent watching own lives in demand without regard for actual living."
