A recent review of the "No Child Left Behind" law, enacted by Congress in 2004 and signed into law shortly thereafter by George W. Bush has revealed another startling example of Executive Privilege. A practice begun with Roosevelt, presidents have frequently amended bills upon signing them into law by annotating their own interpretations of the bill's intent. Left undiscovered until now, in part because Mr. Bush did not attach anything to the law but instead punctuated the title:    
    
"NO! Child... 'Left Behind'?"    
    
Scholars and judges have yet to decide what, if anything, should be done following this revelation. Spokesman for the White House, Donald Thisbit, announced to reporters, "This is yet another fine example of a president who has the foresight to follow through on his initiatives."
