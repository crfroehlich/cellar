The world is a small, flat rock which rests evenly in the palm of your hand. As you toss it lightly into the air, the accompanying thump against your palm inspires confidence.    
    
This world could be skipped across a lake. It could just as easily break a window into a thousand neat shards of unordered glass. The world could fell a giant.    
    
It is with some regret, then, that you dropped it on the side of the road.
