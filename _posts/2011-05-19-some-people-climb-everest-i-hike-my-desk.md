It's been said that behind every great man is a [Tenzing Norgay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay). Behind me are ten.    
    
Many try to scratch the itch of ambition with the satisfaction of goals which can actually be achieved.    
    
Walking on the moon.    
Discovering non-carbon-based life.    
Falling in love and drowning there.    
President of the World?    
    
Contrary to the social norms and conventions which traditionally define success, I look to Sisyphus. That guy (albeit involuntarily) attempted to do the impossible. That smarts of the kind of irrational optimism this world desperately craves.    
    
So, too, will I. I will hike my desk. A infinite number of miles over a finite (working) lifetime. Each mile down a mile no closer to the goal.    
    
But I'll do it.    
    
Because it's there.
