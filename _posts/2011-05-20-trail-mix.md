What hiker does not need nourishment on the journey toward nirvana? Google has some advice in the form of advertisements, should one be so bold as to enter their spam folder.    
    
"Savory Spam Crescents - Bake 12-15 minutes or until golden brown".    
    
I can see [others have found recommendations](http://bemusedboomer.blogspot.com/2010/02/savory-spam-crescents.html) for the same (we can only assume) delicious tidbit.    
    
When I make camp tonight, I will have to venture into the nearest town and gird myself with the necessary supplies. 7 miles across the plain has stirred the ancient hunger.
