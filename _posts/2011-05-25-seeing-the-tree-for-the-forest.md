My hike today spanned the 3500 km of the Appalachian Trail. The journey I embarked when I began hiking my desk has already connected me with remote corners of the world, and as I reflect on the truths these excursions have imparted, I am wont to ponder the [details that I have missed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo).    
    
Like much of the rest of life, the value of the hike is in the journey and not the destination; we hike our desks both as an alternative to a quest for self or meaning--as these goal-oriented journeys [fail the tests of scalability and time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ekBkF2OXI), and as a quiet affirmation: escaping the [vast, unknown possibilities of the human experience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ8MqvwNVds&feature=player_embedded), I know with certainty only that I can hike my desk.    
    
Such is the satisfaction of the hike.    
    
Thanks to [Kevin Gallagher](http://www.anothergallagher.com/) for providing [today's hike](http://vimeo.com/20218520).
